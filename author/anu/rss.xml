	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><strong>So, here is how my ~60 days in Singapore looks like.</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>first week</strong> was mostly getting accustomed with the Commute system and routes here, definitely apart from understanding and learning more about the company you are part of.</p>

<p><strong>Transportation:</strong> MRT, Buses and cabs (Grab, Go-Jek, running Taxi)</p>

<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> 
For local transport(MRT and buses both) you can get an ezlink card from any of the MRT stations and top-up the card whenever needed.
One alternative is setting up the Google Pay or Apple Pay (for iOS app - you should have Singapore apple ID). 
You can also use your debit card for the same. To know more checkout SimplyGo app. 
If none of these works out for you, you can also buy tickets from the bus driver or MRT ticket counter each time.</p>

<p><strong>Cost:</strong>
MRT/Buses as expected are the cheapest means of transportation (Range S$0.83 - S$2.08)
Cabs are quite costly (avg. $10 to $20). Grab is usually costlier than Go-Jek. If you want to travel somewhere late at night, running taxi can be considered as there might be surge pricing for cab services.</p>

<p><strong>The best app to navigate:</strong> City Mapper (honestly, I find it better than Google map’s navigation feature)</p>

<p>The <strong>second week</strong> is mostly the settling week.</p>

<p><strong>A place to stay:</strong>
There are multiple apps to help you find a place to stay, like PropertyGuru, 99.co, Roomgo, etc
There is also a Facebook group named “Flat and Flatmates” where you can find good deals.</p>

<p>You can either rent 1bhk or rent a room in 3bhk or so. There are two types of apartment,
* Condo (Condominiums)
* HDB (Housing &amp; Development Board)</p>

<p>Unlike HDB, Condo apartment has facilities like swimming pool and gym. 1bhk in a condo apartment will roughly cost you around S$1,700 to S$2,000 or more per month depending on the location. HDBs are comparatively cheaper, you can get a master room in about S$1,300 - S$1,500 monthly (fully furnished).</p>

<p><strong>SIM card and Bank Account:</strong></p>

<details>
  <summary>Recommended options for SIM</summary>
  <p> 
     * Singtel: ~ $20 to $38 monthly
     * Circles.Life: ~ $18 to $38 monthly (with more/unlimited data offers)
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Popular bank options:</summary>
  <p> 
    * OCBC (Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation) - OCBC 360 Account
    * DBS (Development Bank of Singapore) - DBS Multiplier account
  </p>
</details>

<p>You need an address proof for both, to get a sim card (postpaid) and to create a new bank account. You can get a <em>prepaid sim</em> card from the airport itself.</p>

<p>If you are here for anything other than tourism you should create a <strong>Singpass</strong> account. A Singpass is a common password that allows users to connect and transact with government agencies in Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>Food:</strong>
We usually either order food online or go out nearby to the office to have lunch during the weekdays.</p>

<p>There are two types of dining places,</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Restaurant</strong>, Depending on the area, say, Clarke Quay, Arab Street, Robertson Quay,  the cost will be $30 to $40 for a complete meal, whereas, in restaurants near Little India, you can get a full course meal in about $15 to $30.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hawker Center</strong>, when you are out of your balance or feel like having a budget meal, hawker centre is a decent place for nonvegetarians and there are few options for vegetarians too.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Food ordering apps:</strong>
Grab Food
Deliveroo</p>

<p>Ordering food online via any of these apps, the avg cost per meal per person will range from $8(Subway) to $20(proper Indian meal). You can buy free delivery subscriptions in the Grab app if you plan to order food quite often.</p>

<p><strong>Pharmacy:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Guardian</li>
  <li>Watson</li>
  <li>Unity (fairprice pharmacy)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Supermarkets &amp; Convenience Stores:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>NTUC FairPrice (Open 24 hours - Most of the stores)</li>
  <li>FairPrice Finest (Till 11 PM , only a few are open 24 hours)</li>
  <li>7-Eleven (Open 24 hours - Most of the stores)</li>
  <li>Cheers (Open 24 hours - Most of the stores)</li>
  <li>Esso (Open 24 hours)</li>
</ul>

<p>Last but not the least, you must know about <strong>Little India - especially Mustafa</strong>
If you are from India or love Indian food, Little India is a must-visit place for you. There is a saviour for Indian people here called Mustafa centre (with three wings). You can find any and every needful thing from there.</p>

<p><strong>Touristy places that I have explored so far:</strong>
East coast park, Marquee, 1 Altitude, a Football match at the National Stadium, Sentosa, Arab street, Orchard Road, Clarke Quay, Boat Quay, Robertson Quay, Ce La Vi, Little India, Chimes, Fireworks on 54th birthday of Singapore….</p>

<p>Stay tuned. :)</p>

	  <title>KDE and getting started with Season of KDE</title>
	  <link>//KDE-Season-of-KDE</link>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><br /></p>

<p>KDE stands for <strong>K Desktop Environment</strong>. It is a desktop environment for Linux based operation system. You can think KDE as a GUI for Linux OS. KDE has proved Linux users to make it use as easy as they use windows. KDE provides Linux users a graphical interface to choose their own customized desktop environment.</p>

<p><strong>Why KDE?</strong>
<br />
&gt; <strong>Integration</strong>: KDE is well integrated with many applications of all kinds. Applications do not have to be written specifically for KDE, and all of the applications that are typically part of the GNOME desktop also work just fine in KDE <br />
&gt; <strong>Looks</strong>: I like the many ways in which I can change the look of the KDE Plasma workspace. Sometimes we like to set colours and looks to suit our moods. Icons, widgets, fonts, pointers, the window decorations, and much more can also be changed, and you can download and install new ones if those already installed are not right for you. <br />
&gt; <strong>Flexibility</strong>: KDE allows me to define the functions of the mouse buttons, how windows behave, and how to deal with new devices that are plugged in such as whether to mount them if they are storage devices and which applications to open automatically.
<br /></p>

<p>And here is where the GUI desktop combines with the CLI to enhance user exp. The feature I find most useful is the fact that the Konsole window allows for multiple tabs with a separate terminal session in each tab.</p>

<p>It took me by surprise, how huge the KDE community is and how flawlessly this team works co-operating on development and distribution of Free, Open Source Software for desktop and portable computing. It is an amazing community with more than 50 million users, where people can freely download and use an app or
can read the source code, learn, grow and contribute.
<br />
And the best part is for contributing in KDE and become a part of you need not necessarily be a developer, There are many different ways you can become part of this,</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Development</strong>: If you like coding and want to work on a project to add new features or resolve any bug,  collaborating with people from all around the world.</li>
  <li><strong>Translation</strong>: If you are good at multiple communicating language, you can help KDE in globalizing by translating texts of KDE software</li>
  <li><strong>Art</strong>: if you have got artistic skills and like creating new images and theme, a large audience of KDE are keen to see your artwork</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation</strong>: if you wish to help users to understand how to use the software and keep text files up to date</li>
  <li><strong>Promotion</strong>: if you want to be part of a flexible team which spreads the word of KDE to expand its user range</li>
  <li><strong>KDE bug squad</strong>: By keeping track of incoming bug reports, verifying them, improving them and cleaning them up, you will help developers figure out what bugs they need to work on and help them get the information they need to fix them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Do check out the <a href="https://community.kde.org/Get_Involved">KDE Community Wiki</a> for more details.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>KDE has many application domains which can be categorized as</p>

<p><br />1. <strong>KDE - Development</strong>
- e.g. KDevelop IDE for CPP files KDiff3 and Kompare creating diff patch</p>

<p><br />2. <strong>KDE - Education</strong>
- e.g. Kalzium for chemistry     Kletters for alphabet edu   KAlgebra for maths</p>

<p><br />3. <strong>KDE - Games</strong>
- e.g. KDiamond: Three-in-a-row game    KPatience: Patience Card Game            KSudoku: Sudoku Game</p>

<p><br />4. <strong>KDE - Graphics</strong>
- e.g. KPhotoAlbum    Photo Album    KolourPaint Paint Program  <br />
Karbon Scalable Graphics</p>

<p><br />5. <strong>KDE - Internet</strong>
- e.g. KNode News Reader    KRDC Remote Desktop Client    KGet Download Manager</p>

<p><br />6. <strong>KDE - Multimedia</strong>
- e.g. KMPlayer Media Player    KsCD CD Player    KMix Sound Mixer</p>

<p><br />7. <strong>KDE - Office</strong>
- e.g. Kontact Personal Information Manager        KOrganizer Personal Organizer
Plan Project Management</p>

<p><br />8. <strong>KDE - System</strong>
- e.g. Konsole Terminal     Dolphin File Manager    KSystemLog  System Log Viewer</p>

<p><br />9. <strong>KDE - Utilities</strong>
- e.g. KCalc Scientific Calculator     KJots Note Taker     KTimer Countdown Launcher
KFileReplace Search &amp; Replace Tool</p>

<p>There are more than 200 applciations in the KDE domain, refer the list <a href="https://www.kde.org/applications/">here</a>
<br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>What is Season of KDE?</strong>
<br />
Season of KDE is a community outreach program that has been hosted by the KDE community for nine years straight, wherein contributors across the globe participate, learn and develop together. This season of KDE is of about 4 months. student or the budding contributors and mentor application submission begin in December. Before submitting the proposal, students are expected to have a clear understanding of the project and idea. The first month of the programme is communicating period where students exchange ideas with the expected mentor, through IRCs and mailing lists. Mentor verifies the feasibility of the idea. In case you are not able to come up with your new idea, SoK idea page has few projects mentioned there, if you find any of those ideas interesting, you are supposed to first understand the project and the idea and then start connecting with the mentor mentioned along with the idea.
Mentor of SoK is always available for any kind of help you need, you are first expected to ask your queries in an appropriate mailing list or IRC and in case you are unable to find a satisfactory answer or suggestions from there, you can drop a mail to you,, mentor, and there will definitely be a reply within 24 hours, which is mostly expected as there may be time zone difference between your location and your mentor’s.
 <br />
Purpose of the SoK programme is to support as many new budding developers as interested, to begin with, FOSS contribution with perfect mentorship, delivering the best experience of being a part of a big community like KDE, with exciting goodies like T-shirt and certificate.
It is managed by the same team of admins and mentors that takes care of Google Summer of Code and Google Code-in matters for KDE, so we can say it is very much like Google Summer of Code
<br />
<strong>Why SoK:</strong>
<br />
- Flexible timeline
- Best Mentorship
- Goodies
- Certificate
- Experience
- Exposure
<br />
<strong>Getting started with SoK/contributing to any of the projects in KDE?</strong>
<br />
It is highly recommended for you to first go through some of the applications you like and look at the technologies used, which mostly are CPP, Qt and QML. Refer <a href="https://techbase.kde.org/Contribute">link</a> which provides all the information about:
- Mailing List/ News
- Reporting bugs
- Coding.
<br />
Now let’s study each if the process a little more in detail:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>First</strong>: <em>how to subscribe to the mailing lists, What are the norms and where can you find the news feeds (The Dot)</em>
<br />
As already mentioned mailing lists are the best way to know the current status of any
The project, new features being added and contributions being made currently, it is very much similar to personal e-mail communications with more than one recipient, where you will be getting the notification periodically acc to the span that you opt for daily or weekly.
https://mail.kde.org/mailman/listinfo
Click on the list name and subscribe by entering your email id, and you will get the mail in as forums.
 <br /></li>
  <li><strong>Second</strong>: <em>How to report bugs</em>(search if it already exist or file new bug), create a new account of not already present, <em>Review board</em> software for performing reviews on code changes where everyone can cross-check the changes and is approved by the team.
 <br /></li>
  <li><strong>Third</strong>: <em>Getting started with the coding- <a href="https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials">C++, Qt</a></em>
 <br />
C++ is the core technology being used in most of the projects under any domains, so you are not comfortable with it, it is highly recommended to first learn and how the structure and syntax of C++ language.
Qt is a cross-platform framework with tools designed to streamline the creation of applications and user interfaces. KDE Frameworks is a collection of libraries and software frameworks by KDE that serve as the technological foundation for KDE Plasma 5 and KDE Applications</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The format of projects proposal should be in this</em>
<!--SoKProposalFormat--></p>

<p><br />
find a project that interests you, look at the technologies used, and understand the idea of the project, If you are comfortable with those, you can clone the source code and install the app by referring: Framework/Building. It covers everything from building the framework to configuring file and run-time setup.
It would be easier to use some library for an actual project. Over time, you will find missing features that could be useful. Or if you find a bug you can report them or try fixing previously listed bugs which can be found on KDE Bug tracking System Main Page.</p>

<p>Or if you have an idea of any new functionality that can be added or any new feature, you can go to the mailing list of that specific application, propose the ideas and also get to know more about the developments going under that application.
If you don’t get help from there then you can at any time mail your queries on kde-devel@kde.org and you will get a reply within 24 hours.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with the technologies or you get stuck anywhere, you can read blogs and tutorials, ask for help on the mailing list or IRC, ping the contributors. always Ask. Do not hesitate. Not even once. If needed ask again enlightening any specific part of your query.</p>

<p>Once you are done with the setup and know well enough about a project you can contact a mentor for the same. You can talk about your idea on IRC or mailing list interested mentor will get in touch and then you can get started with your project.</p>

	  <title>📱 Getting started with the multithreading in iOS</title>
	  <link>//Multithreading-in-iOS</link>
	  <author>Anu Mittal</author>
	  <pubDate>2018-11-25T18:40:00+00:00</pubDate>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><br />
With the emergence of multi-core processing chips in all our mobile devices, it has given rise to the possibility of performing multiple tasks simultaneously in the application. In iOS, <strong>in order to keep the application’s UI responsive</strong> 📲, all the heavy task are added in a new thread e.g. networking calls. These threads usually run in the background and send a call back to update the UI if necessary.</p>

<p>Need of multithreading has been perfectly stated in the apple documentation, 
it says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each process (application) in OS X or iOS is made up of one or more threads, each of which represents a single path of execution through the application’s code. Every application starts with a single thread, which runs the application’s main function. Applications can spawn additional threads, each of which executes the code of a specific function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to facilitate and safely manage these additional threads we need a framework like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/DISPATCH">dispatch</a></p>

<p>✍🏼 <strong>Ways to achieve multithreading:</strong><br />
- Grand Central Dispatch<br />
- <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/thread">NSThread</a><br />
- <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/operationqueue">NSOperationQueue</a></p>

<p>This blog assumes you have basic understanding of these types.</p>

<p>When it comes to comparing these methods:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Code/Structural Origins:</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>GCD is a low-level C-based API.</li>
  <li>NSOperation and NSOperationQueue are Objective-C classes (a wrapper on GCD).</li>
  <li>NSThread is an NSObject (uses pthreads).</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Complexity comparison:</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>For GCD implementation is very light-weight</li>
  <li>NSOperationQueue is complex and heavy-weight</li>
  <li>NSThread is just wrapper to pthreads therefore making it lightweight too.</li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">NSOperation advantages over GCD and NSThread:</code><br />
You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up a dependency between two NSOperations hence enables developers to execute tasks in a specific order.</li>
  <li>Pause, cancel, resume an NSOperation once the task as started its execution therefore give it control over the operation’s life cycle.</li>
  <li>Monitor the state of an operation like: ready, executing, or finished.</li>
  <li>Specify the maximum number of queued operations that can run simultaneously.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly, NSOperationQueue provides you more control over the operations.</p>

<p>Once you have decided which methodology you want to use, you need to decide the order and priority of it.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Order of Operation:</code><br />
Queues can be of two type: Serial Queue or Concurrent Queue which runs the tasks synchronously and asynchronously respectively
<!--[Queues][queuesType]-->
<img src="/assets/images/multithreadingiOS/queuesType.png" alt="Queues" width="100%" /></p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Priority of operations:</code><br />
Priority is defined as Quality of Service known as QoS and is of following four types:</p>

<!--[QoS][QoS]-->
<p><img src="/assets/images/multithreadingiOS/QoS.jpg" alt="QoS" width="80%" /></p>

<p>Let’s now try to understand these operation by predicting the output of couple of examples.<br />
Before trying to answer the output of code below, let’s look at the documentation of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1453057-dispatch_async">dispatch_async</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchqueue/1452870-sync">dispatch_sync</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Dispatch_async:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>🤞🏼 Declaration<br />
	void dispatch_async(dispatch_queue_t queue, dispatch_block_t block)<br />
	👥 Discussion<br />
	This function is the fundamental mechanism for submitting blocks to a dispatch queue. Calls to this function always return immediately after the block has been submitted and never wait for the block to be invoked. The target queue determines whether the block is invoked serially or concurrently with respect to other blocks submitted to that
	 same queue. Independent serial queues are processed concurrently with respect to each other.<br />
	💁🏻‍♀️ Summary<br />
	Submits a block for asynchronous execution on a dispatch queue and returns immediately.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Dispatch_sync:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>🤞🏼 Declaration<br />
	void dispatch_sync(dispatch_queue_t queue, dispatch_block_t block);<br />
	👥 Discussion<br />
	Submits a block to a dispatch queue for synchronous execution. Unlike dispatch_async, this function does not return until the block has finished. Calling this function and targeting the current queue results in deadlock.
	Unlike with dispatch_async, no retain is performed on the target queue. Because calls to this function are synchronous, it “borrows” the reference of the caller. Moreover, no Block_copy is performed on the block.
	As an optimization, this function invokes the block on the current thread when possible.<br />
	💁🏻‍♀️ Summary<br />
	Submits a block object for execution on a dispatch queue and waits until that block completes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now try these out:<br />
In which order would these logs get printed? Suggest you to give it a try before looking at the solution.</p>

<!--[async Sync Quest][asyncSyncQuest]-->
<p><img src="/assets/images/multithreadingiOS/async_sync_quest.jpg" alt="asyncSyncQuest" width="100%" /></p>

<p>What is given to us?<br />
A new “queue” is created from global queue (which means it’s a concurrent queue).
We are given 2 dispatch task and few NSLog to be printed to understand the flow.</p>

<p>So the output will be:</p>

<!--[Async Sync Output][asyncSync]-->
<p><img src="/assets/images/multithreadingiOS/async_sync.png" alt="asyncSync" width="100%" /></p>

<p>As we were expecting the string after the async block is printed first, followed by the tasks under the block.
The reason is quite clearly stated in the documentation, the async task return immediately after the submission.</p>

<p>Agree to me? BUT…</p>

<p>There is a twist: 🔀 <br />
As we have created a concurrent queue from the global queue and added it to an async dispatch, sure it returns immediately after submission, but the whole point of creating a async dispatch is to allow multiple threads to execute concurrently. So here the main queue (the task of printing “anumittal %num”) and the task in the async dispatch queue can run simultaneously. So you can also expect output in this order:</p>

<!--[Async Sync Output Random][asyncSyncRandom]-->
<p><img src="/assets/images/multithreadingiOS/async_sync_random.png" alt="asyncSyncRandom" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Making sense?</p>

<p>Similarly, now predict the output if instead of dispatch_async in the first example we had dispatch sync.
Once again before looking at solution, try to answer it yourself.</p>

<!--[sync sync Output][syncSync]-->
<p><img src="/assets/images/multithreadingiOS/sync_sync.png" alt="syncSync" width="100%" /></p>

<p>As the documentation says: “this function does not return until the block has finished” 
In the sync_sync block, everything happens in the most calmest way. :blush: it prints “1 01 001” then comes another dispatch_sync and the outer one will not continue to line 46 until line 41 to 44 are executed.</p>

<p>But suppose the inner queue was async then it would immediately return and line after 45 and after 40 will execute simultaneously.
<!--[sync async Output][syncAsync]-->
<img src="/assets/images/multithreadingiOS/sync_async.png" alt="syncAsync" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Last variant would be when both the queues are dispatch_async. 😃</p>

<p>I am sure you must have guessed the output.
<!--[Async async Output][asyncAsync]-->
<img src="/assets/images/multithreadingiOS/async_async.png" alt="asyncAsync" width="100%" /></p>

<p>It will be all concurrent.</p>

<p>Congratulations 👏🏼 you have understood the essentials of multithreading. If you get confident with these examples, I am sure you can now play around with threads in your applications.</p>

<p>Also, you must try creating your own new queues.</p>

<p>Syntax:<br />
<strong>Serial queue:</strong><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">dispatch_queue_t serial_queue = dispatch_queue_create("your.queue.label", DISPATCH_QUEUE_SERIAL);</code></p>

<p><strong>Concurrent queue:</strong><br />
<code class="highlighter-rouge">dispatch_queue_t concurrent_queue = dispatch_queue_create("your.queue.label", DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT);</code></p>

<p><strong>Deadlocks</strong><br />
You should always resist passing same queue (especially a serial queue) to multiple dispatch blocks, as it might lead to deadlock.</p>

<p>For example.
<!--[Serial Queue Deadlock][serialQueueDeadlock]-->
<img src="/assets/images/multithreadingiOS/serialQueueDeadlock.png" alt="serialQueueDeadlock" width="100%" /></p>

<p>The code leads to deadlock condition as, the outer async operation waits for the inner block to start and complete, whereas the inner block will not start until the task in “queue” is completed.</p>

<p>Where as works fine with concurrent queue :
<!--[new concurrent queue][newConcurrentQueue]-->
<img src="/assets/images/multithreadingiOS/newConcurrentQueue.png" alt="newConcurrentQueue" width="100%" /></p>

<p><em>Just to emphasise, this will work but it is not preferred to use the same queue</em></p>

<p>Lastly a good to know example of deadlock:
<!--[smallestDeadlock][smallestDeadlock]-->
<img src="/assets/images/multithreadingiOS/smallestDeadlock.png" alt="smallestDeadlock" width="100%" />
This is claimed to be the shortest code to create a deadlock. I hope by now you must be able to think in the direction to answer as to why would this create a deadlock.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Hint:</code> main queue is a serial queue, this code is trying to dispatch the new code block synchronously on the same queue which is running &amp; waiting on the dispatch_sync.</p>

<p>If this all feels little overwhelming then it’s ok. The more you try out examples the easier it is to understand. Please let me know if you would like to learn any of these topics more in detail.
You can find the project on my <a href="https://github.com/anumittal/multithreading-iOS">github</a>.</p>

<p>In the next blog, we shall look into locks and the most famous readers/writers problem 😊

	     <!--[Campus][akademy-campus]-->
<p><img src="/assets/images/campus.JPG" alt="Campus" width="100%" />
This year Akademy (an annual world summit of KDE) was held in a beautiful city Vienna, Europe during the late second and third week of August.</p>

<p>Akademy like every year had many interesting talks and bofs scheduled</p>

<!--[Akademy talks][akademy-talks]-->
<p><img src="/assets/images/AnuKDE.JPG" alt="talks" width="100%" />
My talk was scheduled on the first day of the event where I talked on Kontainerzing KDE.</p>

<!--![Presentation on Docker][akademy-docker]-->
<p><img src="/assets/images/dockerPPT.png" alt="dockerPPT" width="100%" />
The talk began with a general introduction to Containerization technologies and why we need it. Followed by how we have used Docker and flatpak at KDE.</p>

<p>The presentation is available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LdtW9T0pT2t6RS0c0X7qbXzhjT1v8GvFPARuBtlCGoY/edit?usp=sharing">here</a></p>

It was a great experience to meet active contributor of KDE all around the globe and learn more about the insights. During the KDE India bof, we discussed how we can get more contributors on board and get the most out of conf.kde.in 2019.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing more contributors in India in the conf.kde.in next year.</p>

<p>PS. Call for Hosts for Akademy 2019 is still open. For more, check <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2018/05/15/akademy-2019-call-hosts">here</a></p>

	     <p><strong>Hola Amigos!</strong><br /><br />
<strong>Akademy 2017</strong> was such a great experience, that I would love to share with you all in this post. <br /> For those who are unaware about Akademy, it’s an annual <a href="https://akademy.kde.org">world summit of KDE</a>.
<br /> This year, Akademy was held in <strong>Almeria, Spain</strong>.
&gt;Akademy features a 2-day conference with presentations on the latest KDE developments, followed by 4 days of workshops, Birds of a Feather (BoF) and coding sessions.
<br />There are so many interesting talks given by some real tech enthusiasts, who are amiable and super cool. It is a great opportunity to meet people in person whom you have been communicating just knowing their IRC nickname.<br /><br />So, as mentioned it started with some really interesting presentations on <em>Plasma desktops, Plasma mobile, Ruqola, digiKam, WikiData, GCompris, KIO library, Calligra, KDE neon, Slimbook, Translating Challenges</em>, and many more. We were fortunate to have <strong>Robert Kaye</strong> and <strong>Antonio Larrosa</strong> as our keynote speaker. These presentations were followed by BoF sessions and Workshops.<br /><br /><strong>I conducted a workshop on Qt Quick Control 2</strong>, <em>Paul Brown</em> had some awesome stuff to share on what data should be visible to a viewer who visits your site or uses your product. Parallelly there was a BoF session, where the team brainstormed on Plasma mobile and Plasma vision.<br /><br />It was such pleasure to meet <em>Valorie, Aleix Pol, Albert, Lydia, John Samuel, David, Timothee, Vasudha, Jonathan</em> and so many more active contributes of KDE.<br />[Memories of Akademy 2017]
&gt;<strong>How is KDE Akademy different than conf.kde.in?</strong><br />I have been a part of <a href="conf.kde.in">KDE India conference</a> held in Jaipur in 2016. Which looked like this: <br /> When you see this, you find so many students, keen to learn about <em>FOSS and KDE community</em>. <br /> All are budding developers with some spark and unexplored ideas in their mind. So such type of conferences held by KDE in India help these unexplored ideas to come into execution by using and developing features in the various softwares build by KDE developers. <br /> Whereas, when you look at these bunch of developers here in this picture: <br /> This is the group photograph of Akademy 2017 attendees. They are the backbone of all softwares in KDE, expert and deeply involved in contributing in KDE.</p>

<p><br /><em>I would like to thank KDE for giving me this opportunity. It has added great experience and wonderful memories to my journey of foss development</em> <br /><br />PS. Help make KDE apps and Plasma easier to use, more convenient and accessibl by supporting <a href="https://dot.kde.org/2017/08/08/randa-meetings-2017-its-all-about-accessibility">#Randa2017</a></p>

With the end of this month comes the end of such an amazing programme<br />"Google Summer of Code 2016".<br />As planned earlier I have successfully implemented GSL library to construct histogram for both static as well as dynamic input values.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_NbC7Wc_ixE/V8BtP-MMS7I/AAAAAAAALy8/urITgW_7IbkCIBY9gZu4dwNNGSY7nk8VACK4B/s1600/HistogramOption.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_NbC7Wc_ixE/V8BtP-MMS7I/AAAAAAAALy8/urITgW_7IbkCIBY9gZu4dwNNGSY7nk8VACK4B/s320/HistogramOption.png" width="320" /></a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wNtZXjZjTwY/V8BtR5uZm4I/AAAAAAAALzE/2TDpLhNgYq8Lbw7QZIC7hKMG0_4ClASqACK4B/s1600/RandomValuePlotted.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wNtZXjZjTwY/V8BtR5uZm4I/AAAAAAAALzE/2TDpLhNgYq8Lbw7QZIC7hKMG0_4ClASqACK4B/s320/RandomValuePlotted.png" width="320" /></a><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0SJmTkuFhQQ/V8BtThyws2I/AAAAAAAALzM/uyAI3D-hXCIaSJtIm4bWRaAl5YJVjCOFACK4B/s1600/ValueFilling.png" imageanchor="1" style="display: inline; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0SJmTkuFhQQ/V8BtThyws2I/AAAAAAAALzM/uyAI3D-hXCIaSJtIm4bWRaAl5YJVjCOFACK4B/s320/ValueFilling.png" width="320" /></a><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Now, a user can <br /><ul ><li>Draw different types of histogram for a given set of values.</li><li>Change the method of selecting the bin value.</li><li>Change background and filling of histogram graph.</li><li>Alter the properties of histogram graph scaling (auto-scale. color, pattern).</li><li>Mark the magnitude of bin ( individual or cumulative).</li><li>Draw/plot more than one curve on same worksheet to enhance the analytic study/comparison.</li></ul><div>Though the programme has come to an end, I will continue contributing in KDE community and LabPlot. I would like to thank all my mentors in Labplot.<br />Working demo:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHjYvmInXY8&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHjYvmInXY</a></div><div><br /></div><div>Thanks for reading :)</div></div>
